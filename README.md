# pico-dev

A place for notes on learning Raspberry Pi pico project development.

A C development environment is preferred because of the author's familiarity 
with the language, and the opinion
that it forces one to have a deeper understanding of the system.

# Equipment

- Dell desktop (purchased use from a vendor on Amazon)
- several pico and pico W
- USB to serial converters
- breadboards
- jumper wires, a.k.a. [Dupont wires](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronics/comments/ioc6sf/i_finally_foundout_why_dupont_connectors_are/?rdt=36730)
